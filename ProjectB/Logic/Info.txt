This layer contains all code dealing with the logic.
Calculating stuff, checking stuff, transforming data, etc...

For grouping purposes we’re going to connect this with the data layer.
So, each section of the data will have its own place in this layer.



No WriteLines or ReadLines are going to be in here!​
